* Pygor
  The friendly servant that makes sure your project runs correctly.

** Usage
   Feed Pygor a list of make commands and it will run them on the
   current directory. When an error is encountered pygor will send you
   an email informing you of the situation.

   You should provide 4 files to =Pygor=:

   - The paths to the interesting repositories relative to the
     root.
   - A list of emails that =Pygor= will use to contact about the status
   - The log file that =Pygor= will use to keep track of what is going
     on.
   - A list of the directives to be passed to make.
